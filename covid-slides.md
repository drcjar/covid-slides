# Caveat emptor

#

This is written by respiratory doctors for an audience that includes medical students in the midst of a pandemic; it's a fluid situation, lots of research is being done and information contained within may become stale quickly. If you spot a bug or inaccuracy please ping me at [drcjar@gmail.com](drcjar@gmail.com) or submit a pull request [https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/](https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/) and I will fix.

#

With thanks to Richard Turner, Clare Ross, and Marsten Hillier who helped with earlier versions of this slide deck.

# Learning objectives

#

At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to...

- define SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
- describe the basic epidemiology of COVID-19
- summarise the key clinical features of COVID-19
- describe initial management of the disease, including infection control procedures
- assess disease severity and judge chances of a successful outcome with intensive care

# sars-cov2 and covid-19

#

- Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the bug; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the pneumonia that the bug causes

# {data-background="images/sars_cov_2.jpg"}

- SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus (approximately 120 nm in diameter) from a family of viruses called coronaviruses.
- Corona means crown; it's called coronavirus because the virus is spherical and has spikes which look like a crown when viewed down an electron microscope.

# basic epidemiology of covid-19

#

- WHO informed of outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019; declared public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020; declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020

#

- R0, the basic reproduction number of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.
- RE, the effective reproduction number, is currently [1.2-1.3 for the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-r-number-in-the-uk)
- Reducing transmission by reducing social contact, wearing a mask, and washing hands, 'Hands. Face. Space.', is important to reduce RE. 

#

- Incubation period thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure

#

- As of 16/01/21 over two million COVID-19 deaths world wide. One in 50 people in England and one in 30 people in London are currently infected; for most people it's a mild self-limiting disease characterised by cough and fever secondary to respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, a small subset of people with disease need hospital admission and a small subset of those need ITU.

#

- Pandemic is putting pressure on NHS services; [overall case fatality rate is probably around 1%](https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/) (rates are higher for older people and those with comorbidities, country figures depend on case definition and how much testing is done; note also infection fatality rate is lower since some people are infected but never become symptomatic and so never become a case).

#

- Risk factors for disease include include having contact with a confirmed case [risk factors for more severe disease (and death) include being older, being male, having comorbidities such as pre-existing respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases, obesity, diabetes, cancer, dementia and smoking.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2521-4)

#

- Droplet (dominant means of transmission, can't travel more than 1m, can persist on surfaces, surgical mask helpful).
- Aerosol ([WHO currently think not an important route](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions) , can travel more than 1m, surgical mask not helpful).
- Social distancing, hand hygiene, and in a hospital setting [appropriate use of PPE](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874411/When_to_use_face_mask_or_FFP3.pdf) are important.

#

- Be aware of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) including intubation, extubation and related procedures, tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures, manual ventilation, open suctioning, bronchoscopy, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP), surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used, high-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV), high-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO), induction of sputum, some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).

- Wear appropriate PPE if you are exposed to AGP (at time of writing this is FFP3 as a minimum); make sure you learn to [doff and don PPE safely (having a buddy helps)](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/ppe/ppe-sequence.pdf)

#

- Don't take COVID-19 home; change your scrubs or clothes ideally before leaving work, but certainly on arriving home, and wash clothes just as you normally would (virus dissolved by normal detergent on a normal wash)

# vaccines

#

- mass vaccination programmes are now underway world wide
- in UK three MHRA approved vaccines currently: Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna (RNA vaccines), Oxford/AstraZeneca (adenovirus vector vaccine)
- currently offered to priority groups only

# key clinical features of covid-19

#

- It's a chameleon (can present in lot of different ways, can hide in plain view)

#

- Typical presentation is cough and fever 4-5 days after exposure
- Other features include breathlessness, fatigue, myalgia, anorexia
- Less often chest pain (2-5%), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea/vomiting 1-10%, abdo pain approx 2%) and neurological symptoms e.g headache confusion (9%), dizziness (9-12%)

#

- Differential diagnosis broad; plenty of diseases can mimic including flu, disease can also co-exist
- No reason to think usual population diseases are going to go away so Hickam's dictum is likely to apply: "A man can have as many diseases as he damn well pleases."

#

- Investigations to confirm diagnosis (and rule out differentials) and grade severity
- Basics include SpO2 (+/- arterial blood gas), full blood count (lymphopenia common), U&Es, LFTs, CRP, troponin and D-dimer (both associated with increased mortality), CXR (bilateral infiltrates), nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and sputum for micro (there's a molecular test), serological test soon

#

- Even with 'gold standard' testing (multiple micro samples) and CT chest sensitivity and specificity only around 90% i.e false-negative and false-positive results are seen.

#

Patients who are too breathless to carry out their activities of daily living need hospital assessment. Patients who show signs of respiratory distress and/or have low oxygen saturations (e.g < 94% on air) need hospital assessment. 

#

- Current management is oxygen therapy (titrated to achieve local target oxygen saturations), 10 days of dexamethasone 6mg od (RECOVERY trial) for those who are inpatients requiring oxygen (ppi cover and glucose monitoring and control as necessary), antibiotic cover if intercurrent bacterial infection is suspected, and prophylactic anticoagulation. ['Intermediate' anticoagulation may be considered for those who are severely unwell.](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng186) Critically unwell patients may benefit from [tocilizumab or sarilumab](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/remap-cap-il-6/).

#

- Important to consider non-COVID-19 disease (bacterial pneumonia, asthma, COPD exacerbation, PE, other respiratory conditions, and any other cause of fever, depending on clinical presentation). [Do not consider a PE solely on the basis of d-dimer](https://www.bsti.org.uk/media/resources/files/Rationale_for_CTPA_in_Covid_considerations_F.pdf)

#

- Important to isolate patient and take [appropriate respiratory precautions](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874411/When_to_use_face_mask_or_FFP3.pdf)
- Basic PPE for all suspected cases (surgical mask, gloves and apron); respirator (FFP3) mask, visor/goggles if aerosol generating procedures/high risk environments (e.g. intubation, non-invasive ventilation, chest physiotherapy, tracheostomy care, bronchoscopy)

#

- Important to consider, and discuss with patients and document ceilings of care; clinical frailty score can be helpful in assessing who is likely to benefit from critical care.

#

- Important to be careful with fluids (no role unless patient is shocked, might make oxygenation worse), no role for routine antipyretic administration to treat fever

#

- Important to escalate early and discuss with ICU (if appropriate according to ceiling of care) and if requiring increasing respiratory and/or multiple organ support

#

- Important to use appropriate PPE (we can't look after our patients if we don't look after ourselves), to not be at work if you, or someone in your household, shows symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (follow PHE and local guidelines). important to check if you should be at work or not if you're pregnant, have a pre-existing medical condition, or take immunosuppressants.

#

Patients are discharged when they are stable and no longer require oxygen (average length of stay is around 7-10 days). All patients at NMUH are referred to our covid follow up clinic and provided with safety netting advice that should their symptoms worsen or they have any other concern they should seek medical attention. 

#

Most people get better. Small number of people have persistant symtoms e.g long covid. Fibrosis and pulmonary embolism can complicated recovery. 

# Useful contacts

#

- COVID team, ITU, Palliative care, Site manager, Bed manager, Psych liaison, Infection protection control
- [Induction app](https://induction-app.com/) is usually good

# nota bene

#

- It's a pandemic; demand will outstrip supply, we all need to pull together to do the best we can for our patients with the limited resource we have, we will all have important parts to play, no task that helps our patients is too small (and none of us are too big for any task that helps our patients).
